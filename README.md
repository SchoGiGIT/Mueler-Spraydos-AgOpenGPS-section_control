**_Why control the buttons mechanically and not switch section through relays?_**
* Motorised valves need 2 relays per section (16 in total...).
* You cannot put ralays in parallel to the buttons, you will create a short.
* To keep the switches as manual backup they cannot be replaced by relays.
* Breaking the lines going to the the valves and changeing the state there with relays could work. But the rate controller will not work anymore since it does not know the real state of the sections. (You could compensate this by changeing the speed signal however)
* To keep the mod as a bolt-on addon to keep the controller original for resale when the time comes.
